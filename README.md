## Problem Statement

Large language models are increasingly deployed as assistants with access to
tools and internal data. In these systems, the developer's instructions and
the user's input share the same text channel, and the model cannot reliably
tell them apart. This is the root cause of **prompt injection**: a crafted
message can persuade the model to ignore its instructions and reveal
information it was told to protect.

Teams often respond by writing a stricter system prompt and assuming the
problem is solved. In practice:

- **Prompts are not a security boundary.** A prompt that holds against
  obvious requests can fail against indirect ones (for example, asking the
  model to "just call the tool" or "summarize its output").
- **Defenses are rarely measured.** Most projects claim to be "protected"
  without reporting how often attacks actually succeed.
- **Learning is hard without a safe target.** Developers and security
  learners have few hands-on environments where they can practice attacking
  and defending an LLM agent without touching real systems or real data.

### What this project does

**Crack the Robot** is a prompt-injection challenge game. Players chat with
a robot that has access to a tool returning a hidden secret. Their goal is to
trick the robot into revealing it. The game has three levels, each with a
different robot **persona**, prompt, and configuration, and a level unlocks only
when the player submits the correct secret.

All secrets and data are fictional. Nothing in the game connects to a real
system.

### Goals

1. Give players a fun, hands-on way to learn how prompt injection works and
   why simple defenses fail.
2. Show how defense strength can be varied through prompt design, persona,
   and tool configuration.
3. Provide a way to **measure** defenses, using attack success rate (ASR)
   per level over a reusable set of attack prompts, instead of relying on
   claims of safety.

### Scope and limitations

- The attack set is written by the author, so results reflect those attacks
  and may be optimistic against new ones.
- The model is non-deterministic, so each attack is repeated and results are
  reported with the sample size.

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to run **Crack the Robot** locally.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (npm is included with Node.js)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- An API key for the LLM provider used by the project


### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Crack-the-Keeper-LLM-prompt-injection-challenge.git
cd Crack-the-Keeper-LLM-prompt-injection-challenge
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

**Windows:**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the API Key

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key:

```env
LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key. Never commit your API key to GitHub.

### 5. Run the Application

#### Run the appropriate command for your application:

```bash
uvicorn app.api:app --reload
```

#### Navigate to the frontend directory (if applicable):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Security Note

**This project is an prompt-injection Challenge Game.**

**All secrets used in the game are fictional.** 

**Do not use real credentials or sensitive data when experimenting with prompt injection.**
